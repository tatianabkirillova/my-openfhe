# TO-DO:

- [x] plain evaluation till a given degree
- [x] degree 13 should give accuracy of 96.60 (96.5955) -> 98.6
- [x] generate coefficients with polyfit
- [x] plot to check coefficients
- [ ] try generating coeffs from more points
- [x] encrypted evaluation till a given degree w/o splitting the the coefficients
- [x] test the accuracy
- [ ] figure out when to split coefficients: thresholds
- [ ] test different functions
- [ ] transform to python?
- [ ] figure out what parameters scaleModSize & batchSize do

# Polyfit

I use numpy.polynomial to generate coefficients for the chebyshev approximation of the sigmoid function

# Accuracies

Using MAPE to measure accuracy
