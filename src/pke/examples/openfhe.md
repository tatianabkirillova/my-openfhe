# TO-DO:

OK: plain evaluation till a given degree

O: degree 13 should give accuracy of 96.60 (96.5955) 

O: encrypted evaluation till a given degree w/o splitting the the coefficients

O: test the accuracy

O: figure out when to split coefficients: thresholds

O: generate coefficients with polyfit

O: test different 

# Accuricies

Using MAPE to measure accuracy 

## Degree = 13

Expected sigmoid:         [ 0.562177 0.622459 0.679179 0.731059 0.880797 ]

Expected approx:          [ 0.542979 0.585682 0.627836 0.669175 0.821422 ]

Result:                   (0.542979, 0.585682, 0.627836, 0.669175, 0.821422,  ... ); Estimated precision: 43 bits


Accuracy with mape (compared to sigmoid):                93.5822%

Accuracy with mape (compared to plain evaluation):       93.5822%
