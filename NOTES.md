# TO-DO:

- [x] plain evaluation till a given degree
- [x] degree 13 should give accuracy of 96.60 (96.5955) -> 98.6
- [x] generate coefficients with polyfit
- [x] plot to check coefficients
- [ ] try generating coeffs from more points
- [x] encrypted evaluation till a given degree w/o splitting the the coefficients
- [x] test the accuracy
- [ ] figure out when to split coefficients: thresholds
- [ ] test different functions
- [ ] figure out what parameters scaleModSize & batchSize do

# Polyfit

I use numpy.polynomial to generate coefficients for the chebyshev approximation of the sigmoid function

# Accuracies

Using MAPE to measure accuracy 

# Splitting 

The higher degree the more accurate is the approximation.

Too small coefficients result in a computational error

Precision according to IEEE 754 standard:

single precision 32-bit: around 7 decimal digits

double precision 64-bit: around 15-17 decimal digits

# Errors

```
Plaintext: (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2,  ... ); Estimated precision: 50 bits

The error means the set multiplicative depth is too small
